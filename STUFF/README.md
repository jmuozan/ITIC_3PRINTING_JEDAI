# 3D Printing Workshop Structure

## 1. Introduction (30-45 mins)
- Brief history and importance of 3D printing
- How 3D printing is used across industries (including software development)
- Basic terminology (FDM, SLA, filament, slicing, etc.)
- Overview of the 3D printing workflow: Design → STL → Slice → Print

## 2. Understanding 3D Models (45-60 mins)
- 3D coordinate systems and geometry basics
- Introduction to STL files - what they are and how they work
- **Hands-on**: Write a simple STL file in code
  - Show them the triangle mesh structure
  - Create a basic shape (cube or pyramid) programmatically
  - This connects well with their programming background

## 3. 3D Design Approaches (60 mins)
- Traditional CAD software overview (brief demo of Fusion 360 or TinkerCAD)
- Programmatic design using OpenSCAD or similar
- **Demo**: AI-assisted design using Meshy
  - Text-to-3D model generation
  - Modifying AI-generated designs 
  - Advantages and limitations

## 4. Preparing Models for Printing (45-60 mins)
- Introduction to slicing software
- Critical print settings:
  - Layer height
  - Infill
  - Supports
  - Print speed
- Common printing issues and how to avoid them
- **Exercise**: Slice a model and examine the G-code

## 5. Hands-on Printing Session (60-90 mins)
- Printer setup and safety
- Loading filament
- Starting a print
- **Activity**: Have students print their code-generated STL or AI-designed models

## 6. Advanced Topics & Applications (30-45 mins)
- Combining programming with 3D printing
  - Generative design
  - Parametric modeling
  - Data visualization through 3D printing
- Real-world applications relevant to programmers

## Workshop Materials & Setup

- Prepare simple code templates for STL generation in languages they're familiar with
- Set up computers with necessary software:
  - A code editor or IDE
  - Slicing software (Cura, PrusaSlicer)
  - Access to Meshy or similar AI design tools
- Prepare sample STL files and G-code for demonstration
- Have 3D printers ready and calibrated

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or provide sample code for the STL generation exercise?
